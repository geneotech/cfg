summary: What needs to be done on the system.

introduce convenient single-file cpp build
	(perhaps should work on f5/f6/f7 or just s+f7?)
	should run a command like gdb sth sth

we could assume that the exe has always the same name as the exe

If we're playing with neovim terminal, set scrollback=1 clears scrollback

update activity-watch
update alacritty as well
test out the vimagit

gdb could read the core produced by standard ensure faults
