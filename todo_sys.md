summary: What needs to be done on the system. 
---

system maintenance
	- update activity-watch
	- update alacritty as well
	- test out the vimagit

vim should always use zz whenever navigating through anything?
	- except N, n, /, ? etc

we could assume that the exe has always the same name as the exe

If we're playing with neovim terminal, set scrollback=1 clears scrollback


plan carefully the system's bash scripts behaviour for building, running etc 
	- with bullet poitns!
	- introduce convenient single-file cpp build
		- (perhaps should work on f5/f6/f7 or just s+f7?)
		- should run a command like gdb sth sth

c+s+n should open a new buffer in some predefined folder
